# Assignment 4: Jupyter Introduction

* **INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT**
* **How to submit**: 
  - Submit your Python Notebook files to your GitHub repository (same used for the other assignments). The files should be called *"Assignment4_Wallets.ipynb"* and *"Assignment4_PTable.ipynb"*. You will work on top of your previous Assignment ([HW3](03_dictionary_list.md)), and each file corresponds to one of the exercises on that HW.
  - I will evaluate the latest commit before the deadline

**The assignment:**

Revisit your previous assignment ([Homework 3](03_dictionary_list.md)) and create a Python Notebook for each of the exercises on that assingment.

Please provide clear explanations using Markdown cells for each of the code in code cells. Also, break your code in ways that each code block can be explained as an atomic piece. Functions should be in a single box. 

Remember to provide the code chunks in a way that if one executes it top-down everything will work,

I hope you all have fun with this :-)
