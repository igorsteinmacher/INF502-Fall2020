### Wallets

You are requested to request a user of your application to provide 5 numbers representing the value in cash stored in 5 different wallets.
Your program should store these five values in a list.
When finished, your application should provide the following information:
* "The fattest wallet has $ value in it."
* "The skinniest wallet has $ value in it."
* "All together, these wallets have $ value in them."
* "All together, the total value of these wallets is worth $ dimes"

Please try to think about different functions to complete your work

## Periodic Table 

The Periodic Table of the Elements was developed to organize information about the elements that make up the Universe.
Write a terminal application that lets you enter information about each element in the periodic table.
Make sure you include the following information:
* symbol, name, atomic number, row, and column

Provide a menu of options for users (inputing numbers) to:
1. See all the information that is stored about any element, by entering that element's symbol.
2. Choose a property, and see that property for each element in the table.
3. Enter a new element
4. Change the attributes of an element, by entering the element's symbol.
5. Exit the program

**You can provide a pre-populated dictionary as part of your program, avoiding the need of typing every time**
