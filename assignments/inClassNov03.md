### BeautifulSoup + Pandas:

1. You are required to write a function that scrapes the Wikipedia article with 
the list of countries by population (Main Table)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density). 
We do not want to collect the data related to "World" (Find a way to skip these lines).
Collect the following information:
* Country name
* Area (km2)
* Area (mi2)
* Population

2. Put your data into a Pandas Dataframe!!! Make sure you have the numeric columns as numbers

3. Provide a summary of your data (average, mean, etc.)

4. Calculate the correlation between your columns

5. Plot a scatterplot (population vs. area (km2)
